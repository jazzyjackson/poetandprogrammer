**Day 3 Plan: Working with Data Structures**

Objective: Learn about lists and dictionaries in Python by building a simple to-do list application with the help of an AI assistant.

**Exercise 1: Basic To-Do List**

1. Study the concept of lists in Python using online resources or the AI assistant.
2. Ask the AI assistant to provide an example of creating and manipulating a list in Python.
3. Write a function to add a task to a to-do list, which is stored as a list.
4. Write a function to display the tasks in the to-do list.
5. Develop a main function that serves as the user interface for the to-do list application, including a loop for continuous operation, options to add tasks, view tasks, and exit the program.
6. Test the to-do list application with the AI assistant's help to ensure it works as intended.

**Exercise 2: Adding Task Priorities**

1. Study the concept of dictionaries in Python using online resources or the AI assistant.
2. Ask the AI assistant to provide an example of creating and manipulating a dictionary in Python.
3. Modify the existing to-do list to store tasks with priorities using a dictionary.
4. Write a function that adds tasks with priorities to the dictionary.
5. Update the task display function to show tasks and their priorities.
6. Update the main function to include options to add tasks with priorities and display the tasks with their priorities.
7. Test the updated to-do list application with the AI assistant's help to ensure it works correctly.

**Exercise 3: Removing and Updating Tasks**

1. Learn how to remove items from a dictionary in Python using online resources or the AI assistant.
2. Write a function that removes tasks from the to-do list based on their name.
3. Learn how to update values in a dictionary in Python using online resources or the AI assistant.
4. Write a function that updates the priority of a task in the to-do list.
5. Integrate the new functions into the main to-do list application.
6. Update the main function to include options for the user to remove tasks and update task priorities.
7. Test the final to-do list application with the AI assistant's help to ensure it works as expected.

Throughout the day, the student will rely on the AI assistant as a guide and resource for learning about data structures and building the to-do list application. The AI assistant can provide explanations, examples, and guidance as needed, helping the student to understand the concepts and apply them to the exercises.
