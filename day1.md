Apologies for the previous suggestions being too ambitious. Here are three simpler exercises for Day 2, focusing on string manipulation and text generation:

**Exercise 1: Character Counter**

Objective: Create a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of occurrences of that character in the string.

1. Have the student define the problem and give examples of input strings and characters and their corresponding counts.
2. Ask the AI assistant to write a skeleton function for character counting, including function definition, input parameters, and a return statement.
3. Instruct the student to write the logic for the character counting function using a loop and a counter variable.
4. Teach the student to call the AI assistant to test the function with various input strings and characters to ensure the character counting function is working correctly.

**Exercise 2: Word Length Calculator**

Objective: Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the average length of words in the string.

1. Have the student express the problem and give examples of input strings and their corresponding average word lengths.
2. Ask the AI assistant to write a skeleton function for the word length calculator, including function definition, input parameters, and a return statement.
3. Instruct the student to write the logic for the word length calculator using string splitting and loop techniques.
4. Teach the student to use the AI assistant to test the function with various input strings to ensure the word length calculator is working as intended.

**Exercise 3: Simple Mad Libs Game**

Objective: Create a simple Mad Libs game that asks the user for different types of words (e.g., noun, adjective, verb) and inserts them into a pre-defined story template.

1. Have the student outline the desired functionality for the Mad Libs game and prepare a simple story template with placeholders for user input.
2. Ask the AI assistant to write a function for collecting user input for the required words, including function definition, input parameters, and a return statement.
3. Instruct the student to write a main function that calls the input collection function, replaces the placeholders in the story template with user input, and prints the final story.
4. Teach the student to use the AI assistant to test the Mad Libs game by playing it and providing various types of words as input.

These exercises should provide a more suitable introduction to Python programming for Day 2 students, focusing on basic string manipulation and text generation. Students will learn about control flow and function definitions while utilizing the AI assistant for coding help.
